# Prominent Features
## Random Powerup Spawns
The game has several powerups, in our game they are flavored after various drugs in a satirical fashion, which spawn and affect the gameplay. The spawns are located at four possible locations, and each location spawns a random powerup from a list on a varied spawn rate. Nothing will replace a powerup until it is collected. Once the powerup is collected, the spawner picks a random time amount to wait until it spawns another powerup chosen at random from the list.

## Powerups and Effects
- ### Cocaine / Increased Speed
The Cocaine powerup resembles white poweder on the ground. Once collected, it multiplies the speed of the player who picked up. This effect is able to be stacked multiple times. The speed effect is removed after a time limit until the player returns to the normal player speed. The increased speed can be used in conjunction with the sprint ability to make the player's extremely quick.

- ### PCP / Incresed Player Size
The PCP powerup is a blue pill, and it makes the player double in size. This is another effect that can stack multiple times and is ended by a timer expiring. While the player increases in size, so does their hitbox for the ball making it easier for them to push the ball across the pitch and harder for the other player to score or pass beyond the player.

- ### Weed / Slows Time
The Joint, or Weed, powerup causes a time dilation effect like slow motion to occur on the field. The effect slows the way time is accrued by the engine so other effects may appear to last longer. This also causes players to appear to move slower and the ball to travel more slowly.

## Separate Customizable Character Controls
One less glamorous feature I worked to implement into the game, was the ability for a player to be able to set up custom controls for how their character is controlled. I had the controls stored in a .ini file that could be customized outside the game as well. The controls are read in and stored as a map/dictionary/hashtable depending on your preferred language. The game can then read the input from the .ini file into the map and write out any changes to the file as well. Although this is a often overlooked feature, when it is missing in a game, it is typically noticeable right away to players.
